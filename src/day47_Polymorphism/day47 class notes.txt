Polymorphism (Many forms): Ability of the objects to take on many forms
			  "IS A relation" is a must

			  Reference type is parent class/interface, and object type is child class

			  Reference type decides what can be accessed/called

			  Object type decides which implementation to execute


Dynamic Polymorphism: Method overriding
					 One method with multiple implementations

Static Polymorphism: Method over loading
					Multiple methods with same name
					each method has one implementation ONLY
